/-- `Algorithm α β` represents a general iterative stochastic optimization algorithm.

It models a sequence of updates where:
- `α` is the search space (e.g., parameters, candidate solutions),
- `β` is the evaluation space (e.g., objective values, feedback),
- `ν` is the initial probability measure over `α` (the starting distribution of candidates),
- `kernel_iter n` is a Markov kernel that outputs a new candidate in `α`
  given the history of the first `n` points and their evaluations,
  i.e., from the space `prod_iter_image α β n` = (`α × β`)ⁿ,
- `markov_kernel n` asserts that each such `kernel_iter n` is a valid Markov kernel.

It allows formal reasoning over joint distributions of evaluated points and convergence
properties. -/

/-- Given a continuous function `f : α → β` representing the evaluation (e.g., objective function),
this constructs a new kernel that maps a history of points (in `iter α n`)
to a probability distribution over the next point in `α`.

The original algorithm `A` provides a transition kernel `A.kernel_iter n` that depends on
both the previously proposed points and their corresponding evaluations.
However, in practice, the algorithm itself only generates the sequence of points,
and the evaluations are computed externally by applying `f` to each point.

The function `prod_eval n f` deterministically reconstructs the full history
(points and their evaluations) from the point sequence alone, using `f` and
the `comap` pulls back the original kernel along this map,
resulting in a kernel that operates directly on the sequence of points. -/

/-- The measure on infinite sequences of iterations. It is constructed by first obtaining
a kernel from `iter α 0` to `ℕ → α` via the Ionescu-Tulcea theorem, and then averaging the kernel
over the initial measure `A.ν_mequiv`. This gives a measure on the space of infinite sequences
of points in `α`, which can be used to analyze the convergence properties of the algorithm. -/

/-- Monotonicity of the algorithm's induced measures under trajectory extension.

Let `s : Set iter α n` be a measurable set of point sequences of length `n`,
and `e : Set iter α m` for some `m ≥ n` a set of longer trajectories such that
every `u ∈ e` satisfies `subTuple hmn u ∈ s`.

Then the measure assigned to `e` by the algorithm at step `m` is less than or equal to
the measure assigned to `s` at step `n`.

This expresses that the family of measures is projectively consistent:
the measure on longer trajectories contracts to the measure on shorter ones via truncation.

Formally: if `e ⊆ {u | subTuple hmn u ∈ s}`, then `A.fin_measure hf m e ≤ A.fin_measure hf n s`. -/

/-- If two continuous functions `f` and `g` agree on a measurable set `s`, then the algorithm's
induced measures at iteration `n` are identical when restricted to trajectories that stay
within `s`. This establishes that the algorithm depends only on the objective function values
on the relevant domain. -/
